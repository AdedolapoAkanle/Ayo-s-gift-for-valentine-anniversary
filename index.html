            help installing that software on my laptop? I was probably stressing
            about it lol, and you just... stepped in. No hesitation. You walked
            me through it so patiently and really gave it your all. Even though
            we couldn’t get it to work in the end, the way you showed up for me
            told me everything I needed to know.

            That's when I knew you were different. You were willing to help,

            <p>My Love,</p>

            <p>
              One year. 365 days. Thousands of texts. Hundreds of calls.
              Countless "I miss yous" and "I love yous". And somehow, it feels
              like both forever and just the beginning.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've been sitting here trying to figure out how to say this. How
              do you put a feeling this big into words? How do you explain what
              it's like to find someone who just... gets it? Who gets you?
            </p>

            <p>
              Before you, I didn't know love could feel like this. Safe and
              exciting at the same time. Peaceful but electric. I didn't know
              someone could make me want to be better without ever making me
              feel like I wasn't enough. You do that. Every day.

              There are moments... small ones, quiet ones, that nobody else will
              ever see. Like when you look at me a certain way and I just know
              you're thinking about our future. Or when you send me a message at
              midnight just because you missed me. Or how you'll text me
              pictures of us in the middle of your day because you know it'll
              make me smile. Those moments? That's where I live now. That's
              where my heart is.

              I think about the person I was before I met you. She was scared of
              a lot of things—scared of being too much, scared of not being
              enough, scared of trusting the wrong person. But you made all of
              that fear disappear. Not because you promised me anything, but
              because you showed me, day after day, that I could trust you with
              all of me. The good parts, the messy parts, the parts I'm still
              figuring out. You hold all of it with such care.

              This distance has taught me something I didn't expect: love isn't
              about being together all the time. It's about choosing each other,
              over and over, even when it's hard. It's about staying when
              leaving would be easier. It's about building something real, even
              when you can't physically see it yet.
            </p>

            <p>
              I know we have hard days ahead. Days when the time difference
              feels impossible. Days when missing you physically aches. Days
              when we'll wonder if we're crazy for doing this. But I also know
              that every single one of those days will be worth it. Because at
              the end of all of this? We get forever.
            </p>

              You are my favorite person in the entire world. Not just because
              of who you are, but because of who I am when I'm with you. You
              make me brave. You make me laugh until I can't breathe. You make
              me feel seen in a way I've never felt before. You make me believe
              in us.
            </p>

            <p>
              So here's what I want you to know: no matter how far apart we are,
              you are home to me. You are my safe place. My best decision. My
              greatest adventure. My always.
            </p>

            <p>
              I love you. Not just for who you are, but for who we are together.
            </p>

            <p>
              And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life showing you exactly
              how much.
            </p>
