            Remember when we were just getting to know each other and I needed
            help installing that software on my laptop? I was probably stressing
            about it, and you just... stepped in. No hesitation. You walked me
            through it so patiently, explained everything, made sure it worked
            perfectly.
            <br /><br />
            That's when I knew you were different. You were willing to help,
            even when we barely knew each other. You cared. And that meant
            everything. 💻💕

            drives together were everything. Just us, the music, the
            conversation, the vibe. And those runs! You made me start running
            with you because my lazy ass needed motivation (and honestly, I just
            wanted to do everything with you). I miss those moments. But we'll
            have them again. Real drives. Real runs. Together. Soon. 🚗🏃‍♀️💕

            There's nothing I love more than our quiet moments. Just you and me,
            shutting out the world. Talking, laughing, being vulnerable, showing
            each other love in every way. You make me feel safe. Cherished.
            Completely yours.
            <br /><br />
            Those are the moments I treasure most. When it's just us, no
            distance, no screens - just our hearts beating as one. 💖

            <p>My Love,</p>

            <p>
              One year. 365 days. Thousands of texts. Hundreds of calls.
              Countless "I miss yous" and "I love yous". And somehow, it feels
              like both forever and just the beginning.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are my best friend, my safe place, my home - even from 5,683
              miles away. Thank you for loving me the way you do. For being
              patient with the distance. For making me feel like the most
              special person in the world, even when we're oceans apart.
            </p>

            <p>
              I watch you work hard in school - construction engineering, growth
              & marketing management, diving deep into Web3 and crypto. I see
              you give your all on the football field, push yourself while
              running (and pushing me to run with you!). You don't just dream -
              you DO. And you never forget about the people you love along the
              way. That's what makes you extraordinary.
            </p>

            <p>
              I love how sweet you are. How thoughtful. How nerdy (in the best
              way 🤓). How you get lost in books, podcasts, new ideas. How you
              remember every little thing. How even with ADHD making focus hard,
              you always find a way to make me feel prioritized. Those
              late-night talks, our drives back when you were still here, our
              runs together, staying in, listening to Amapiano, Asa, Wizkid, The
              Cavemen - those moments mean everything to me.
            </p>

            <p>
              From that day you helped me install software on my laptop when we
              were just getting to know each other, to now - you've always shown
              up for me. You prove your love through action, not just words.
            </p>

            <p>
              This website is my way of saying: I see you. I appreciate you. I
              love you more than words in a message could ever express. You make
              distance bearable. You make love feel easy. You make me believe in
              us every single day.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here's to one year down and forever to go. To being in the same
              city again. To real drives with you (not just memories of when you
              were here). To running together again. To "I miss you" turning
              into "I'm home". To building the life we dream about.
            </p>

            <p>Happy Anniversary, baby. You are my greatest adventure.</p>

              P.S. - You know how you're always tapping your screen a million
              times on TikTok? And how you love to doodle when we're on
              FaceTime? I made sure this website has a little surprise for you -
              tap anywhere and see what happens. It's just like your tapping
              habit, but now it's ours. Every tap is a heart, just for you. 💕
